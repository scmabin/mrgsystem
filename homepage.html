<h3>Agreeing to Exam Security Policy and Procedures</h3>
	<p>
		All AP students deserve a fair and uniform testing experience, whether they are taking the exam in Connecticut, California, or China.
	</p>
	<p>
		To help make this happen, the AP Program requires every AP student to read, agree to, and follow the “Test Security and Test Administration Policies and Procedures” that appear each year in the Bulletin for AP Students and Parents.

	</p>
    <p>
    	On exam day, before you can take your AP Exam, you will be required to sign your answer sheet, indicating that you have read and agree to follow all the policies and procedures in the Bulletin for AP Students and Parents. You will also need to sign the covers of your multiple-choice and free-response booklets, affirming statements related to the security of the exam.
